#Node C++ Implementation

This is the node implementation for linkedLists, trees, queues, and stacks. Wrote it off of a pseudocode in one of my books. Not something hard, but I couldn't find an implementation of it anywhere... So, here you go!!!
Also, to any computer science students checking this out, you don't need to do all that exclude BS just to get it to work.
